            This is a really simple note taking app created in Flask. I have since moved on to using Django as it is far more powerful, but this was my first introduction to backend software, and was lots of fun to make. If I remember correctly I made this while following along with a TechWithTim video, and then added some of my own features on. It is currently not active, but you are welcome to use it. Code linked below.
