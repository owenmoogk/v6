            I just finished the first version of The Compiler. It was heavily inspired by Janik's <a href="https://repository.tools/" class="blinks" target='_blank'>Repository</a>.
            I wanted to mess around with it and learning a bit about dark mode and that sort of thing. I'm going to be honest, it is really ugly.
            Will I make another version? Maybe. Anyway, it is now up live at <a href="http://thecompiler.cf" class="blinks" target='_blank'>thecompiler.cf</a>. Feel free to check it out!
