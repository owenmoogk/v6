			I recently stumbled upon some other work that showcased how fireflys use those around them to adjust their blinking, and from small interactions the whole group becomes syncronized. I thought it was really interesting, so I wanted to do it with pygame. It sort of works at the moment, but I would like to allow them to move about and then try with that added layer. Code link below! :)
