            I was looking into manipulation of images with Javascript, so I decided to create something to grab colors from an image and get the pixel data.
			I know there are a few others but they are populated with ads and really annoying to use so this does have a practical purpose for me. I also know of a few other people who use this, so it feels really good to make something that has an impact, no matter the size.
