			I was looking at different types of algorithms in python and javascript, and wanted to make a visualizer to show how they work. I started in pygame, and made a pathfinding visualizer. It is pretty cool, and works well. It can use lots of different searching techniques. I had to do a lot of googling for A*, but I also implemented Dijkstra's and Greedy Best First Search. The code is linked below.
