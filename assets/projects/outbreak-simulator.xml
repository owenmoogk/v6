			In the midst of COVID, I was looking at how computers can simulate disease outbreaks such as the one we are experiencing right now.
			I made this as a proof of concept simulating immunity, death, and contact tracing. It was cool to learn and try new things with this.
			I made it in python using pygame. I also learned about graphing in MatPlotLib and saving csv data, which was cool. You can check out the code linked below.
